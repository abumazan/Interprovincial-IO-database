
1. Data preparation
Add the data files  "census.csv","IPIO.csv", and "trade.csv" to your MATLAB "Current Folder". They are economic census data, IPIO table, and trade data, respectively. You can find them in folders named "1997","2002"... etc.

2.Run the program
First, add the M file "gras" to your MATLAB "Current Folder". It is a function for GRAS algorithm.
Second, run the program in the file named "Codes" to yield the IPIO tables with three firm ownerships.
Note: the number of industries for 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017 is 42, but it is 40 for 1997. 

3. Table output
The table is written to an excel file named "IOT". You can find it in your  MATLAB "Current Folder".
